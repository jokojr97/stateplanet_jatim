To use additional character sets for StatPlanet Plus, please follow these steps:

1. copy the file 'content.swf' in this directory into the directory 'web'.
(replacing the existing file)

2. remove the file "settings.csv" in the main directory and also in the
directory 'web'.

3. in the StatPlanet Data Editor, go to the sheet "Settings".
Under Startup options - Data format, select: TXT (tab-separated values).

The file content.swf contains additional character sets,
and therefore the file-size is larger than the original content.swf.
